# Sudoku_with_solver

A simple python implementation of sudoku with a solver using the backtracking algorithm.

* To play, click on a square to mark it and press on the desired number.
* It is also possible to hover over the desired square with the mouse and then press the number key.
* To erase a number, press the '0' key.
* When the user wishes to solve the puzzle, press enter to trigger the backtracking algorithm. NOTE, this is irreversable at the moment so the user must wait for the algorithm to finish.
